					<hr>
					<p style="font-size:15;">
						The decision to adopt a cat should not be taken on a whim.
						It is possible to take care of a cat for 15 years or more.
						Shelters are full, and giving your cat away to a friend often results in the cat being abandoned
						on the street or at a pet shop, where it will be sold to whoever pays more, or simply dumped.
						Can you handle such a long-term responsibility? There will be a need for veterinary care during
						these years.
						Can you afford to take your cat to a reputable veterinary clinic whenever necessary?Cats are
						prone to fungal infections.
						Do you have the means to provide your cat with adequate treatment for a month or two, if it
						becomes infected?
						Can you keep your cats' litterboxes clean on a regular basis?
						Cats cause allergies in many people. Can you assure yourself that no one in your family is
						affected?
						There are grooming requirements for cats. Do you know what these requirements are and can you
						meet them?
						The refusal of a family member to have a cat at home results in many cats being abandoned. Is
						everyone in your family comfortable with the idea of having a cat at home?
						Is there a plan for where your cat will be kept if you travel and cannot take it with you?
						Can you be sure that it provides your cat with everything it needs, not just food and water?
						During the expected lifetime of your cat, are any members of your household pregnant or planning
						to become pregnant?
						Are you aware of Toxoplasmosis if so? Will you follow guidelines set by reputable medical
						institutions such as Mayo Clinic?
						Will you abandon your cat if such a situation arises?
						More information about toxoplasmosis can be found <a
							href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/toxoplasmosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20356249">here<a>.
								Are there any other animals in your home? Can they coexist peacefully and understand how
								to introduce themselves?</p>
